## Concourse Pipeline Patterns
This article provides examples of common patterns for platform operations and application development pipelines.

1. [Pipelines with "gated" or manually triggered jobs](gated-pipelines)

1. [Time triggered pipelines](time-triggered-pipelines)


#### In the backlog TBD:

1. Data exchange across tasks and jobs (TBD)
1. Pipelines with tasks loops - same task definition, distinct params for multiple runs (TBD)
1. User credentials management (TBD)
1. Pipeline access control patterns (TBD)
1. Application development pipelines (TBD)
1. Code unit testing pipeline patterns (TBD)
1. Pipelines for multiple git branches (TBD)
1. Serialization of pipelines (TBD)
1. Pipeline inceptors (pipeline of pipelines) (TBD)
1. Pivotal Cloud Foundry application management (TBD)
1. Pivotal Cloud Foundry platform management (TBD)
1. Staged platform upgrade pipelines (TBD)
1. Integrations with files storage and management systems (TBD)
